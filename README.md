## AFrame Exercise

I recreated an illustration of a bunny eating an apple. I believe that its design
with very round/circular shapes lends itself pretty well to a 3D model; however, because 
it is originally a 2D image, there was a bit of difficulty maintaining all the proportions
in a way that makes sense from every angle in 360 degrees. The bunny looks best at the given
camera view. I decided to animate the apple bouncing to add some dynamic movement and to make 
it fit more naturally in the scene (despite it being a little distanced from the bunny's hand).

This exercise was done for LMC 4733: Mixed Reality Design.
